# FridgeTek (2015)

FridgeTek is an early design meant for practice with GUI buiding. The GUI is meant as an interface where a user can 
input the contents of their refridgerator and be given various possible recipes based on the available ingredients.

Let it be know that this is very rudementary and was created by very novice coders at the time.
